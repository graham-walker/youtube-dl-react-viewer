## Install

### Docker Installation

1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/graham-walker/youtube-dl-react-viewer`

2. Navigate to `cd ./youtube-dl-react-viewer`

3. Select the release you want to install `git checkout tags/v1.2.1`
    - Installing from main is not recommended as database breaking changes can be made between releases

4. Set the environment variables by editing `docker-compose.yaml`
    - Set `SUPERUSER_USERNAME` to the desired username for the superuser account
    - Set `SUPERUSER_PASSWORD` to the desired password for the superuser account. Value cannot be `'password'` and must be at least 8 characters
    - Set `JWT_TOKEN_SECRET` to any securely generated random string. At least 32 characters is recommended. Value cannot be `'secret'`
    - If using a HTTPS server set `SECURE_COOKIES=true`. If running locally leave the value as `false`
    - If you are not planning on using yt-dlp set the update command for your fork `YOUTUBE_DL_UPDATE_COMMAND=python3 -m pip install your-fork-name`
    - Other [environment variables](#environment-variables) can optionally be set

5. Build the image and start the container `docker compose up -d` (if using Compose V1 `docker-compose up -d`)

6. Install yt-dlp or your preferred fork to the container
    - Open the container command line `docker exec -it youtube-dl-react-viewer-app-1 /bin/sh`
    - Install yt-dlp `python3 -m pip install --no-deps -U yt-dlp`

7. Access the web app in the browser `http://localhost:5000`
    - Access from other devices on your network by replacing `localhost` with your device ip address (find using `ipconfig` on Windows or `ip addr` on Linux)
    - If this does not work check your firewall settings

8. Downloads can be found in the Docker volume `youtube-dl-react-viewer_ytrv_downloads`

### Manual Installation

1. [Install Python 3.7+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (this step can be skipped on Windows)

2. [Install yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/Installation) and add `yt-dlp` to PATH

3. [Install the latest versions of FFmpeg and FFprobe](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and add `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` to PATH
4. [Install Node.js 18.16.0 and npm 9.2.0](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/)

5. [Install MongoDB 6.0.0](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

6. [Download the Source code (zip) for the latest release of youtube-dl-react-viewer](https://github.com/graham-walker/youtube-dl-react-viewer/releases)
    - Unzip to the location of your choosing
    - Set the environment variables by renaming `.sample.env` to `.env` in `./youtube-dl-express-backend` and editing `.env` (you may need to enable view hidden files and folders)
        - Set `OUTPUT_DIRECTORY` to the location you want to save downloads. Set to an empty directory
        - Set `SUPERUSER_USERNAME` to the desired username for the superuser account
        - Set `SUPERUSER_PASSWORD` to the desired password for the superuser account. Value cannot be `'password'` and must be at least 8 characters
        - Set `JWT_TOKEN_SECRET` to any securely generated random string. At least 32 characters is recomended. Value cannot be `'secret'`
        - If using a HTTPS server set `SECURE_COOKIES=true`. If running locally leave the value as `false`
        - On Windows make sure `FFMPEG_PATH="C:/Path/To/ffmpeg.exe"` instead of `ffmpeg`. Using PATH does not work correctly on Windows
        - If you installed yt-dlp using pip set `YOUTUBE_DL_UPDATE_COMMAND=python3 -m pip install --no-deps -U yt-dlp`
        - Other [environment variables](#environment-variables) can optionally be set

```
When setting environment variables that start with `REACT_APP_` you will need to rebuild the web app for changes to take effect:
```
cd ./youtube-dl-react-frontend
npm install --unsafe-perm
npm run build
```
You can change the favicon and manifest icons by replacing the files in `./youtube-dl-react-frontend/public` and rebuilding the app.

The repo and check for update URLs are hard coded in `./youtube-dl-react-frontend/src/index.js`.

## Downloading

To download videos from the web app you must be signed in with the superuser account.
1. Navigate to the admin panel `http://localhost:5000/admin`
2. Scroll to the jobs section
3. Create and save a new job

    ```
    Job name                        Job display name

    Format code                     Format code used by yt-dlp/youtube-dl when
                                    downloading videos

    Download audio only             Should only audio be downloaded

    Download comments               Should comments be downloaded. Only works
                                    if using yt-dlp
    
    Recode video                    Convert downloaded videos to mp4 to
                                    increase browser playback compatibility

    URLs                            URLs that will be downloaded by the job.
                                    URLs can be individual videos, channels, 
                                    playlists, etc. One URL per line

    Override config                 Arguments passed to yt-dlp/youtube-dl when
                                    downloading. For example, you can set
                                    `--cookies C:/Path/To/cookies.txt` here

    Override uploader               Overrides the uploader for a video 
                                    downloaded by this job. Useful for websites 
                                    that do not return the uploader name in
                                    metadata
    ```
4. Scroll to download section
5. Select the jobs you want to download. Multiple jobs can be selected. Jobs will run in the order they are started

## Importing Already Downloaded Videos

You can import videos already downloaded with yt-dlp/youtube-dl as long as they were downloaded with the `--write-info-json` option.

To import videos from the web app you must be signed in with the superuser account.
1. Navigate to the admin panel `http://localhost:5000/admin`
2. Scroll to the import videos section

```    
Folder to import                    Folder on the server computer to import
                                    videos from

Job                                 Job imported videos will be added to.
                                    Imported videos will appear in the web app
                                    as if have been downloaded by this job

Search subfolders                   Search subfolders for videos

Copy files                          Copy files when importing instead of moving
                                    them

Continue on failed                  Continue importing videos if a single video
                                    fails to import

Override ext                        Sometimes the video file extension cannot
                                    be determined by the importer. If you know
                                    the extension you can set it here
```

If the web app was installed using Docker you will need to copy your existing downloads into the Docker volume before they can be imported.

```
docker cp "C:\Your\Existing\Downloads" youtube-dl-react-viewer-app-1:/youtube-dl/TEMP

# Import this folder
/youtube-dl/TEMP
```

## Issues & Limitations
- **Browser Playback:**
    <br>
    By default the format code `bestvideo*+bestaudio/best` is used. This can sometimes create videos with codecs individual browsers do not support. Try enabling spoof type, use a different browser, or change the format code and redownload.

    To create videos with better browser playback compatibility, try using the format code `(bestvideo[vcodec^=h264]+bestaudio[acodec^=aac])/mp4/best` or enable recode video in job settings.
- **Playlists:**
    <br>
    youtube-dl only downloads playlist metadata if a video was downloaded as part of a playlist. If you have already downloaded a video and then download a playlist that includes the same video, it will not appear in the playlist in the web app. To mitigate this, download videos that appear in playlists before downloading individual videos.
- **Xattrs:**
    <br>
    Windows does not support xattrs. Videos downloaded on Windows will not have xattrs added to them.

- **Windows Path Limit:**
    <br>
    Windows file paths cannot be longer than 260 characters. To prevent errors where downloaded file names are too long to be saved set your output directory to the root of your drive `C:\videos`. Alternatively, you can remove the path length limitation by [enabling long paths](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/maximum-file-path-limitation?tabs=registry#enable-long-paths-in-windows-10-version-1607-and-later).

- **PM2 and Windows**
    <br>
    When running the web app using PM2 on Windows, console windows may briefly flash on the screen when starting a job. This is due to how PM2 interacts when the process it managing spawns sub-processes. You can start the web app with node instead, however, it will not auto restart if it crashes.
    ```
    cd ./youtube-dl-express-backend
    node --require dotenv/config index.js
    ```

## Handling Download Errors

There are two main types of errors that can occur when downloading videos:
1. **youtube-dl fails to download a video**
    <br/>
    This could happen for many reasons: poor internet connection, incompatible format code, broken extractor, private video, etc. These errors are not recorded by the web app. You may be able to spot the error in console output. youtube-dl will try to download the video again the next time the job is run. If you notice a video did not download but do not see an error on the admin page it is most likely because youtube-dl failed to download it.

2. **youtube-dl successfully downloads a video, but the web app fails to import it**
    <br/>
    This could happen if the web app cannot read the metadata returned by youtube-dl or could not determine which files are the video file, thumbnails, subtitles, etc. youtube-dl will not try to redownload the video as it has already successfully downloaded.
    
    You can attempt to reimport videos from the failed to import section of the admin panel. This will likely still fail until a version of the web app that fixes the issue is released. Report import errors [here](https://github.com/graham-walker/youtube-dl-react-viewer/issues).

## FAQ
**Q:** How do I sign in to websites that require a login?

**A:** In job settings open advanced options and add this line to override config `--cookies "/Path/To/cookies.txt"`
#
**Q:** Can I update youtube-dl from the web app?

**A:** You can update youtube-dl from the youtube-dl section of the admin panel.

If you installed youtube-dl with a package manager set the environment variable `YOUTUBE_DL_UPDATE_COMMAND` to the correct update command.
#
**Q:** How can I add uploader icons to the web app?

**A:** Uploader icons for YouTube and SoundCloud can be downloaded from the uploader icons section of the admin panel.

For other websites uploader icons must be downloaded manually and placed in the `./avatars` folder. Use the Network tab of the browser DevTools to find the expected filename. 
#
**Q:** I am running out of space. Can I use a second hard drive or change/add another output directory?

**A:** You cannot set more than one output directory. If you need to change the output directory, stop the web app and change the environment variable `OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`. Move the contents of the previous output directory to the new one. Paths are stored relative to the output directory so you will not need to update anything else.

If you need more space than a single hard drive can offer, use a drive pooling solution like [DrivePool](https://stablebit.com/DrivePool).
#
**Q:** Where files generated by youtube-dl, such as `archive.txt` located?

**A:** These files are located at the base of the output directory. You can also view them from the logs section of the admin panel.
#
**Q:** Can I delete downloaded videos?

**A:** Videos can be deleted from the admin panel, with the option to prevent videos from being redownloaded or not.

If you are deleting videos because you are running low on storage, note that the actual video files are not deleted until the server is restarted.
