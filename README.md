                                    development mode
```
If the web app was installed using Docker you will need to rebuild the image after changing any environment variables by running `docker compose build --no-cache app && docker compose up -d`.

If the web app was installed manually you will need to rebuild the web app frontend after changing environment variables that start with `REACT_APP_`.

Changing `REACT_APP_LIGHT_THEME_LOGO`/`REACT_APP_DARK_THEME_LOGO` will not change the favicon and manifest icons. They can only be changed by replacing the icon files in `./youtube-dl-react-frontend/public` and rebuilding the web app frontend.

**To rebuild the web app frontend:**
```
cd ./youtube-dl-react-frontend
npm install --unsafe-perm
npm run build
```

### Required Environment Variables
These environment variables are required for the web app to run. Ensure they are set in the `.env` file in the repository root directory.

#### `OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`
The location on your device where downloads will be saved.

#### `SUPERUSER_USERNAME`
The username for the admin account. If an admin account with this username does not already exist, it will be created.

#### `SUPERUSER_PASSWORD`
The password for the admin account. The value cannot be `'password'` and must be at least 8 characters long.

#### `JWT_TOKEN_SECRET`
Used to sign the JSON Web Tokens (JWT). The value cannot be `'secret'` and it is recommended to use a random string of at least 32 characters.

#### `SECURE_COOKIES`
Determines whether cookies should be marked as secure. Set to `true` if using an HTTPS server. Set to `false` if running locally.

#### `BACKEND_PORT`
The port on which the web app will be served. The default port is `5000`. If another service is already using port `5000`, specify any other available port.

## Downloading

2. Go to the [admin panel](http://localhost:5000/admin) and scroll to the Jobs section
3. Click the plus icon to create a new job, configure, and save it

    ```
    Job name                        Display name

    Format code                     Format code used by yt-dlp when downloading
                                    videos

    Download audio only             Enable to only download audio

    Download comments               Enable to download comments if supported
                                    for the website
    
    Recode video                    Enable to convert downloaded videos to mp4
                                    to increase browser playback compatibility
                                    (may reduce quality)

    URLs                            URLs that will be downloaded each time the
                                    job is run. URLs can be individual videos,
                                    channels, playlists, etc. One URL per line

    Override config                 Arguments passed to yt-dlp when
                                    downloading. For example, you can add
                                    `--cookies` here

    Override uploader               Treat all videos downloaded by this job as
                                    if they were uploaded by the specified
                                    uploader. Useful for websites that do not
                                    return a uploader name
    ```
4. Scroll to the Download section
5. Select and run the jobs you want to download. Multiple jobs can be selected. Jobs will run in the order they are started

## Importing Already Downloaded Videos

You can import videos already downloaded with yt-dlp as long as they were downloaded with `--write-info-json` and `--write-thumbnail` and the thumbnail and JSON files are in the same folder as the video.

1. Sign into the web app with the admin account
2. Go to the [admin panel](http://localhost:5000/admin) and scroll to the Import videos section, configure, and import

```    
Folder to import                    Folder to import videos from

Job                                 Job imported videos will be added to.
                                    Imported videos will appear in the web app
                                    as if they were downloaded by this job

Search subfolders                   Search subfolders for videos

Copy files                          Copy files instead of moving them

Continue on failed                  Continue importing videos instead of
                                    stopping if a video fails to import

Override ext                        Sometimes the video file extension cannot
                                    be determined when importing. If you know
                                    the extension and it is the same for all
                                    videos you can specify it here
```

> [!CAUTION]
> If the web app was installed using Docker you will need to copy the videos you want to import into the output directory first, then import the videos using the path on the container filesystem.
> 
> 1. Copy your videos from `C:\Your Existing Downloads` to `C:\Output Directory\TEMP`
> 2. In the web app import the folder `/youtube-dl/TEMP`
> 3. After importing `C:\Output Directory\TEMP` can be deleted

## Issues & Limitations

### Video Browser Playback
The default format code used to download videos is `bestvideo*+bestaudio/best`. This can sometimes create a video that cannot be played in the web browser, although this is dependent on the specific web browser and device. If a playback error occurs try: [opening the video in VLC](#how-do-i-open-videos-in-vlc), using a different browser, or changing the format code and redownloading.

To download videos that may have a greater chance of playing in the web browser try using the format code `(bestvideo[vcodec^=h264]+bestaudio[acodec^=aac])/mp4/best` instead, or enable recode video in the download job settings (may reduce quality).

### Missing Videos in Playlists
yt-dlp only downloads playlist metadata for videos if they were downloaded as part of a playlist. If you have already downloaded a video and then download a playlist that includes the same video it will not appear in the playlist in the web app. To prevent this it is recommended to download playlists before downloading individual videos.

### Windows Path Limit
File paths on Windows cannot be longer than 260 characters. To prevent errors where downloaded videos exceed the path length limit, set the output directory to a location as close to the root directory as possible (i.e., `C:\Output Directory`). Alternatively, you can remove the path length limit on Windows by [enabling long paths](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/maximum-file-path-limitation?tabs=registry#enable-long-paths-in-windows-10-version-1607-and-later).

## Scripts
Scripts offer or extend functionality that is not present in youtube-dl-react-viewer by default.

- [A Node.js script to automatically run download jobs at a specified time using a cron scheduler](./examples/nodejs-schedule-download-jobs.js)
- [A bookmarklet to append the URL of the current page to a specified download job](./examples/bookmarklet-append-url-to-job.js)
- [A bookmarklet to start running any number of specified download jobs](./examples/bookmarklet-download-jobs.js)

## Handling Download Errors

There are two types of errors that can occur when downloading videos:
### yt-dlp fails to download a video
This could happen for many reasons: poor internet connection, broken extractor, private video, etc. yt-dlp will try to download the video again the next time the job is run.

### yt-dlp successfully downloads a video, but the web app fails to parse it
If the web app fails to parse the video metadata the video will appear under the Failed to parse section of the admin panel. yt-dlp will not try to redownload the video as it has been successfully downloaded.

You can attempt to retry parsing the video from the Failed to parse section of the admin panel, however, this will likely still fail until a version of the web app that fixes the issue is released. Report parsing errors [here](https://github.com/graham-walker/youtube-dl-react-viewer/issues).

## FAQ
### How do I open videos in VLC?
To open videos from the web app in VLC on PC/Mac you must register the `vlc://` URL protocol. You can do this with [stefansundin/vlc-protocol](https://github.com/stefansundin/vlc-protocol/).

No additional configuration is required for iOS/Android devices.

### How do I download from websites that require a login?

You can download from websites that require a login by passing your cookies to the download job. In job settings under Advanced options in Override config you can set `--cookies` or `--cookies-from-browser`.

If the web app was installed using Docker `--cookies-from-browser` will not work. To pass cookies to a job when using Docker:

1. [Export a Netscape formatted cookie file](https://github.com/dandv/convert-chrome-cookies-to-netscape-format) with the cookies for the desired websites 
2. Save the cookies file to the root of your output directory `C:\Output Directory\cookies.txt`
3. In Override config set `--cookies /youtube-dl/cookies.txt`

### How can I update yt-dlp?

You can update yt-dlp from the yt-dlp section of the admin panel. This will run the value of the `YOUTUBE_DL_UPDATE_COMMAND` environment variable.

### How can I add channel/uploader icons to the web app?

Channel/uploader icons can be downloaded from the Uploader icons section of the admin panel. Icons are downloaded using the third-party service [unavatar.io](https://unavatar.io/). The icon downloader currently only supports YouTube and SoundCloud, other icons must be added manually.

Icons can be added manually to the `./avatars` folder in the output directory. Use the Network tab of the browser DevTools to find the expected filename. 

### I am running out of space. How can I change where videos are downloaded?

To change the output directory stop the web app and set the environment variable `OUTPUT_DIRECTORY` to the new location. Move the contents from the previous output directory to the new one. You do not need to update anything else.

If you need more space than a single hard drive can offer try using a drive pooling solution like [DrivePool](https://stablebit.com/DrivePool).

### How can I delete videos?

Videos can be deleted the Delete videos section of the admin panel.

If you are deleting videos because you are running low on storage be aware that the actual video files are not deleted from the disk until the web app is restarted.

### Where are files generated by yt-dlp such as archive.txt located?

These files are located at the root of the output directory. You can also view them from the Logs section of the admin panel.

### How can I watch videos on my phone or other devices?
You can access the web app from other devices on your local network by replacing `localhost` with the ip address of the device the web app is running on. You can find this by running `ipconfig` on Windows or `ip addr` on Linux. If the web app does not load check if your firewall settings are blocking Node.js or if your router is blocking communication between devices.

### How do I backup my database?
#### Manual Installation
1. Install the [MongoDB Command Line Database Tools](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/database-tools)
2. Run `mongodump /d youtubeDlDB` to backup the database to the disk
#### Docker Installation
