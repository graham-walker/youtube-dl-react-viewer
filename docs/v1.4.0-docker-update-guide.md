# v1.4.0 Docker Update Guide
Version 1.4.0 makes significant changes to the Dockerfile to allow for improvements to configuration, storage, and updating:

- Environment variables are no longer set directly in docker-compose.yaml and now uses the .env file at the project root
- Downloads are no longer stored in the Docker container and now uses a bind mount to store downloads on the host system

**To update an existing Docker installation from a previous version to 1.4.0:**
1. Copy downloads out of the container to a new location `docker cp youtube-dl-react-viewer-app-1:/youtube-dl/. "C:\Output Directory"`

2. Update to 1.4.0 `git pull && git checkout tags/v1.4.0`
4. Copy `.env.sample` to `.env`
5. Edit `.env` and set `OUTPUT_DIRECTORY` to the location you copied files to in the first step and [configure the required environment variables](../README.md#required-environment-variables)
4. Rebuild and start the container `docker compose build --no-cache && docker compose up -d`
5. Delete the old downloads volume `docker volume rm youtube-dl-react-viewer_ytrv_downloads`
